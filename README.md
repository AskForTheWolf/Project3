# Project3

This project is based on a application intended to be the service acting as a "middleman" for connecting the users, clients, and the business together.

The application will allow any person to choose a restaurant and food item of their choice, place an order, see ratings, choose choice of delivery or pickup per order.

Here we used Ruby On Rails for the back-end and Angular.js.

We configured the API configurations and the controller/model setup in the Ruby On Rails.

We used all the Angular files for the multitude of pages and actions.

API: We used "Zomato" as our API for information with over 1.5 million restaurants and over 10,000 cities globally to help with our application.

Design:

Design wise, we chose to make 3 button structure for the botton of the screen for comfort when our userbase is navigating our app. We think this will be a essential part expecially when attempting to achieve a use for the site on mobile platforms.
