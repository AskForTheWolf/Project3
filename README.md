# Project3
It is the third project

BAO/CURRY/ROB LOWE (the less famous one)

In the beginning, we all collaborated on the design/framing of our project.  We decided on a couple approaches and streamlined our ideas on what the app should look like, which pages would handle what, and how to display/store/request info.

From there we deligated what would be the majority of the workload.

Curry would be handling CSS/design, while lending a hand to whatever needed attention in Angular/Ruby, later completing seed info for the DB.

Bao would be focusing more on Angular and Ruby

Rob would put most of his attention on Ruby and Angular.

The design and implementation process took a bit, but we eventually landed on what everything should do and how to handle it.
